## 30 Days of AI Voice Agents | Day 14: Refactor code, clean up, and upload to Github @everyone @here

You're almost halfway through. You have a slow, but working conversational bot. 

Refactor the code to make it more readable and maintainable.
for e.g. 
- you can define schemas (pydantic models) for the request and response types for your endpoints
- you can separate out the logic of 3rd party services (like STT, TTS), define them in a /services folder, and import and use them in your handlers. 
- You can use logging for better logs
- Clean up the code by removing unused imports, variables, and functions.

Upload the code to Github if you haven't already. 

The README.md you made yesterday should make a good addition to the github repo.

**Make the repo public, and post the repo link on LinkedIn.**
